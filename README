Aria
====

This repository houses the Aria compiler/toolchain and the language specification. Please do not use the compiler for non-trivial projects, or anything for that matter. The language is too buggy and not very stable at the moment. 

Sample Code 
===========

// Code shown below is only written to show the various language constructs. 

namespace math {
	struct Vector2 {
		x, y: f32,
	
		fn add(self, other: Vector2) {
			Self {
				x: self.x + other.x,
				y: self.y + other.y,
			}
		}
	}
}

fn allocate_memory(n: usize): u8[]! {
	let mem = gp_allocator_mem(n)?;
	{ mem, n }
}

fn open_file(fpath: string): std::File? {
	// os-specific file handling ...
	if got_handle {
		std::File {
			// ...
		}
	} else {
		none
	}
}
