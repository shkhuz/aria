Aria
====

This repository houses the Aria compiler/toolchain and the language specification. Please do not
use the compiler for non-trivial projects, or anything for that matter. The language is too buggy
and not very stable at the moment. 

Sample Code 
===========

namespace math {
	struct Vector2 {
		x, y: f32,
	
		fn add(self, other: Vector2) {
			Self {
				x: self.x + other.x,
				y: self.y + other.y,
			}
		}
	}
}

fn allocate_memory(n: usize): u8[]! {
	let mem = gp_allocator_mem(n)?;
	{ mem, n }
}

Installing
==========
